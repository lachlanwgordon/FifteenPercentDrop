# 15% Drop
Working out the perfect tyre pressure for your road bike can be tricky. A good rule of thumb is to inflate to match your weight so they drop by 15%. This app makes the calculations easy and takes the guess work out of reading graphs

15% Drop is my first independent mobile app and is available for FREE in the [iOS App Store](https://apps.apple.com/app/fifteen-percent-drop/id1520633732) and on [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.lachlanwgordon.fifteenpercentdrop) for Android.
This app was built using Xamarin Forms, which I love to use for all the mobile apps I work on because it lets me write my apps in C# and have it run on iOS, Android, Windows and several other platforms.

Building this app was made a lot easier and more fun thanks to these libraries:
